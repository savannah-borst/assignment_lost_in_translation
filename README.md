# Assignment 6: Create a Sign Language Translator using React

## Assignment
For the assignment we had to build an online sign language translator as a Single Page Application using the React framework.
To keep track of users and translations we had to use an other [API](https://github.com/dewald-els/noroff-assignment-api) which Noroff made for easy use in our assignments.

It had to include a Start page, Translation page and a profile page.

## How To Use
Go to the following [website]()

Enter a username and on the next page enter a translation to have the text translated to sign language.

To use locally download or clone the repository and run `npm install` then to start to program `npm run start`

## Future
Future work may include:
- Better responsive design
- login credentials with password

## Built With
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[React](https://reactjs.org/)

[React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

[Material UI](https://mui.com/)
